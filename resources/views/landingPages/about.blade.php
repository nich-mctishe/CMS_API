        <p>Full stack web developer, with 3 years professional experience working for global
            agencies based in london on a variety of clients like Santander, Heineken and Doir.
            This combined a variety of BAU work with a series of “one off” applications
            created on tight fixed deadlines. This work included building mortgage and loan
            calculators using an API call to a server that I had set up to store and parse the
            rate data, and served in the front end with angular. I have also built, and hosted,
            full CMS sites for a number of clients to help self-manage their online presence.

            As a person, I am always keen to enhance skillset. I enjoy problem solving and
            know there is always a fitting solution out there somewhere. I admire the beauty
            of well written code, and write to the highest standards myself wherever possible.
            Along with scripted languages, a respect for cultures and their boundaries,
            a knowledge of geopolitical, and ideological history, as well as a basic grasp of
            a number of spoken languages, would make me a multicultered element to any
            multinational company
